User Based Recommender Systems\n","1. Item Based Recommender Systems\n","\n","\n","<br>What is a recommender system:\n","   * Based on previous(past) user-item interactions (behaviors), it predicts the likelihood that a user would prefer an item.\n","   * For example, movie recommendation system suggests people new movies according to their past activities like watching and voting movies.\n","   * The purpose of recommender system is recommending new things that are not seen before from people (interest exploration).\n","   \n","<br>The most classical recommender system:\n","1. User Based Collaborative Filtering\n","    * Collaborative filtering is making recommend according to combination of your experience and experiences of other people.\n","    * First we need to make user vs item matrix.\n","        * Each row is users and each columns are items like movie, product or websites\n","    * Secondly, computes similarity scores between users.\n","        * Each row is users and each row is vector.\n","        * Compute similarity of these rows (users).\n","    * Thirdly, find users who are similar to you based on past behaviours\n","    * Finally, it recommends what you have not experienced before.\n","    * An example of user-based collaborative filtering:\n","        * Think that there are two people\n","        * First people watched 2 movies: lord of the rings and hobbit\n","        * Second people watched only lord of the rings movie\n","        * User based collaborative filtering computes similarity of these two people and sees both of them have watched the movie lord of the rings.\n","        * So the model identified the similarity between these two people. So it will recommend the hobbit movie to second people as it can be seen from the picture below:\n","        *<a href=\"https://ibb.co/droZMy\"><img src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/feq3EJ/resim_a.jpg\" alt=\"resim_a\" border=\"0\"></a>\n","        \n","    * However, User-based collaborative filtering does have some problems and drawbacks:\n","        * In this system, each row of matrix represents a user. Therefore, computing, comparing, and finding similarity between of them is computationaly expensive and will spend too much computation.\n","        * Also, habits of people can be changed. Therefore making correct and useful recommendation can be hard in time.\n","    * In order to solve these problems, the item-based collaborative filtering approach was proposed.\n","\n","1. Item-based Collaborative Filtering\n","    * In this method, instead of finding relationship between users, user-interacted items like movies or stuffs are compared with each other to find item similarities.\n","    * In user-based recommendation system, habits of users can be changed. This situation makes the system hard to adapt. However, in the item-based recommendation system, movies or stuffs does not change quickly over time. Therefore this recommendation performance is relatively stable.\n","    * There are almost 7 billion people (possible users) all over the world. Comparing people similarities (in most cases) is much harder in computation cost than computing item similarities.\n","    * In thee item-based recommendation system, we still need to make user vs item matrix that is also used in user-based recommender system.\n","        * Each row represents a user and each column represents an item like movie, product or website.\n","        * However, at this time, instead of calculating similarity between rows, the model needs to calculate similarity between columns that are items like movies or stuffs.\n","    * An example of how it works:\n","        * Firstly, there is similarity between the movie lord of the rings and hobbit because both are liked by three different people. There is a similarity point between these two movies.\n","        * If the similarity is high enough, we can recommend hobbit to other people who only watched lord of the rings as it can be seen in figure below.\n","        *<a href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/maEQdd/resim_b.jpg\" alt=\"resim_b\"
